        <h2>What is Productivity?</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, I’ve read my fair share of “self-help” books:
          <em>Think and Grow Rich</em>, <em>Getting Things Done</em>,
          <em>7 Habits of Highly Successful People</em>,
          <em>12 Rules for Life</em>, etc. These books generally purport that
          success boils down to cultivating a highly motivated mindset,
          developing persistence, or crafting a streamlined organization style.
          Most of the suggestions in these books are overgeneralizations,
          scientifically inaccurate, virtually impossible to achieve, or don’t
          address the root problem of why someone isn’t “successful”–an
          ill-defined term that this genre irresponsibly equivocates with
          becoming rich. My main gripe with these books is that they are usually
          written by grifters who write self-help for a living and have never
          accomplished anything impressive themselves. Of course, some of their
          suggestions might help <em>some</em> people, and I’d be lying if I
          said I don’t use a few of their tips.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this article is to explain my productivity system
          concisely (it doesn’t require an entire book) and for
          <strong><em>free</em></strong
          >. And no, I’m not going to try to sell you something at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an effort to fill the gap where I think most productivity advice
          fails, I’m going to define productivity as “the completion of
          meaningful work”. This definition intrinsically implies a hierarchy
          for the type and content of work to be completed. Framing productivity
          this way allows me to effectively determine which projects to complete
          <em>right now</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before choosing projects and reorganizing your schedule, you must
          determine what meaningful work is to <em>you</em>. From my point of
          view, meaningful work is progress made on a massive goal, one that a
          person could spend a good portion of their life accomplishing. By
          definition, only completing this type of work will make you
          productive. The last sentence is of such magnitude that it is worth
          being restated: you should only measure your productivity in terms of
          progress towards a high-magnitude goal. This means that doing the
          dishes, working out, and feeding your pet do not count as
          productivity. In fact, minimizing the time you spend on chores aids in
          maximizing your true productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, productivity can be thought of as an optimization
          problem. Optimization problems consist of two parts:
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          1. Maximizing or minimizing a variable (technically called an
          objective function).
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          2. Adhering to a set of constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          The codomain of this objective function is the amount of meaningful
          work that is done. The primary constraints are time and biology. More
          specifically, there is some non-arbitrary maximum amount of time and
          effort you are physically capable of exerting. Finding your
          constraints–your time&effort breaking point–will allow you to maximize
          your production of meaningful work throughout your
          <em>entire</em> life, not just the immediate future. It is not obvious
          what one’s own constraints are, and to find them, it is necessary to
          reevaluate <em>every</em> moment of your day. With some trial and
          error, you’ll be able to implement a schedule that pushes you to the
          edge of these personal constraints, thus maximizing the objective
          function.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Hierarchizing Tasks</h2>
        <p>
          So, productivity is the completion of tasks that contribute to
          accomplishing a high-level life goal. It’s not immediately clear where
          to begin chipping away at this goal. I’ve hierarchized my tasks
          starting from my main goal and working backwards in time. My vision
          for humanity is essentially to eliminate all suffering (or as much as
          is physically possible). This is an impossible goal for one person, so
          the best I can do is contribute to an ongoing project that allows me
          to make maximum use of my skill set; I think that building scalable,
          practical quantum computers is this project, and I have therefore
          dedicated my life for the foreseeable future to accomplishing this
          task. This is probably a 20-30 year goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, I have my long term goal, but what should I do now? I need to
          break this massive goal into smaller tasks.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          1. First, I need to maximize the time spent working in a lab that
          produces high-impact work in quantum computing. This starts with
          joining the best Duke lab available to me. Done!
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          2. But I need to continue this work in grad school, and therefore must
          join the highest-impact quantum lab for my grad program; this goal
          warrants meticulously planning the next 2.5 years of my life (the
          remaining time until applications are due). I’ve made a list of the
          classes I need to take, research I need to work on, tests I need to
          take, awards I need to win, etc. to optimize my scientific skill set
          and become the best candidate possible.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          3. Then, I can sort these tasks into weekly goals over the next year
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          4. From here, it is easy to determine what I should be doing each day.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          5. Of course, I have hobbies, but those only come after the main tasks
          of the day are completed. For me, these are playing chess and solving
          Rubik’s Cubes, both of which serve primarily as a way to rest my
          brain, which is a trick to maximize productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I’ll explain how I attempt to optimize my time every day in
          order to make the greatest possible progress on meaningful work.
        </p>
        <h2>How I Maximize Productivity</h2>
        <p>
          When I started thinking about productivity in terms of optimization, I
          realized that it required deep thought about how I spent every minute
          of the day; I figured out that in order to find my personal
          constraints, I needed to to spend less time on unproductive tasks,
          eliminate brain fog, and increase focus. The day starts with waking
          up, so I’ll begin with sleep:
        </p>
        <h2>Sleep</h2>
        <p>
          As someone with Delayed Phase Sleep-Wake Disorder and frequent trouble
          falling asleep, sleep is really important to me. If I don’t sleep
          enough or I don’t sleep at the right time, I get the chills, can’t
          think, have a headache, and get stomach aches. However, I don’t like
          to oversleep because that cuts into my productivity. So the goal is to
          minimize the amount of time in bed yet maximize the number of hours of
          good sleep.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          1. I got a sleep tracker. I purchased the Oura sleep tracker in August
          of 2019 and it was one of the best purchases I ever made. It is most
          useful for telling you how long you slept during the night, when you
          slept (how long it took you to fall asleep), how many times you woke
          up during the night, and the amount of time you spent in each stage of
          sleep. I used the ring to determine that I have a REM sleep disorder
          (and got this confirmed by a sleep doctor). It turns out that I wake
          up for about 45 minutes every night (and don’t remember it), so to get
          8 hours of sleep (the minimum amount I need to function at my best) I
          need to be in bed for 8 hours and 45 minutes.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          2. After a lot of trial and error, I found that I cannot function well
          if I wake up before 8 am. Therefore, I try to sleep at or before
          11:15pm every night; with this bedtime, I can wake up at exactly 8am
          and get at least 8 hours of sleep.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          3. I take 6mg of melatonin at 9pm which allows me to fall asleep much
          more easily. This addition to my sleep schedule has eliminated 90% of
          my sleepless nights.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          4. I set all my devices to night mode and turn down my lights at 8pm.
          Blue light keeps you up and messes with your melatonin production. Get
          rid of it.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          5. I stop working an hour before I go to bed. This gives me time to
          shut my mind off before I attempt to fall asleep.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          6. I lay in bed for 30 minutes to an hour before falling asleep. I
          usually watch a lecture on history or a sitcom; something interesting
          but not super exciting. When I feel like I’m falling asleep, I
          immediately set my computer aside and allow myself to drift asleep.
        </p>
        <h2>Dieting and Working Out to Eliminate Brain Fog</h2>
        <p>
          Eating the wrong foods at the wrong time and never working out can
          negatively impact your productivity.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          1. Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting. Eliminating
          breakfast, eating lunch at least 3 hours after waking, and eating
          dinner at least 4 hours before bed helps me minimize brain fog.
          Eliminating snacks also helps. Doing this might also help you live
          longer.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          2. I work out at least three times a week. Staying active is
          imperative to feeling good and completing mentally difficult work.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          3. I don’t eat carbs unless it’s after a workout. I find that eating
          carbs places me in a state of brain fog for an hour or two after
          consumption. If I have a small number of carbs after working out this
          effect is usually absent.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          4. I eat mostly healthy food and eat the recommended servings of
          fruits and vegetables.
        </p>
        <h2>Taking Breaks</h2>
        <p>
          After completing an important task, it is imperative that I take a
          short break (maybe five or ten minutes) to let my mind recover for the
          next task. Although multitasking doesn’t usually work, I find it
          helpful to multitask during my breaks; I like to watch YouTube videos
          while also talking with friends, petting my cat, or completing chores.
          This means that I’m doing all non-meaningful work during my breaks.
          While working, all distractions should be ignored, so break time is
          the only time to complete other tasks. I count my main meals (lunch
          and dinner) as my extended breaks and I multitask during these as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like to take Friday or Saturday night off. Typically, I work at
          least 12 hours a day. I’ve tried taking no breaks on the weekends,
          sometimes for a month, and I always end up burnt out and in need of an
          extended break of 2-3 days. However, taking either Friday or Saturday
          night off allows me to work 12 hours (from about 9am to 10pm, 1 hour
          for meals) each day without burning out (this is my personal
          constraint). It’s important that I really take advantage of this time
          off to hang out with friends, party, see family, and do everything
          that I would like to do during the week but can’t.
        </p>
        <h2>Automating Tasks</h2>
        <p>
          You should never have to think about which tasks you are going to
          complete during the day. Everything should be planned in an electronic
          calendar the week (or day) in advance. I keep track of tasks in two
          ways: 1. Google Calendar, where I keep my main tasks (e.g. textbook
          reading, research, and homework) and 2. my daily tasks–like drinking
          water, taking supplements, eating, and working out–are scheduled on
          the Apple Remind app. Eliminating low-level decision making from your
          daily routine is key to freeing up your mind to do meaningful work,
          solve high-level problems, and be focused in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I’ve integrated my expenses into my calendar so that I
          don't have to think about when my subscriptions will charge or when
          I'll have to buy items like toothpaste or hair product. Everything I
          buy regularly (like supplements and razors) is accounted for on a
          calendar, reminder, or a subscription through Amazon to be delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          My workouts and diet are automated too; every meal is on a schedule so
          that I know exactly what I am going to eat just based on the day of
          the week, and the same applies to working out. This optimization idea
          is what inspired my app,
          <a href="https://github.com/hunterkemeny/OneHealth">OneHealth</a>
          (yeah, shameless plug, but its FREE).
        </p>
        <h2>Misc</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve covered most of the big things, but there are some smaller
          details that are important.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          1. I’ve organized my space around completing meaningful work. My
          workspace is configured in a way that such that completing meaningful
          work seems like the path of least resistance. I keep my desk clear,
          and anything I need to grab is in the corner (like pencils) or in a
          drawer (like paper). A clear desk for me equals a clear mind, and this
          way, I don’t need to <em>physically move</em> to access my problem
          solving tools.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          2. I’ve organized my technology around completing meaningful work.
          Keeping my desktop and files organized and accessible also reminds me
          of the work I’ve done to achieve my goals so far.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%">
          3. Lastly, I’ve found that eliminating all social media accounts,
          putting my devices on do not disturb mode during work time,
          unsubscribing from all nonessential mailing lists, and making it
          difficult to reach me during productive hours is helpful.

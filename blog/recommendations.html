        <h1 class="blog-title">Recommendations</h1>
	  <p>I’ve been lucky to have excellent teachers and friends in my life who have supported and encouraged my learning. Many of the pivotal moments in my intellectual development have come from recommendations by people in my community. So, to give back, I’ve compiled a list of books, articles, and videos that have had the greatest impact on my thinking; 90% of the items on this list were recommendations. </p>
	  <br>
	  <h2>Books</h2>
	  <p><em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em> by Walter Miller is the single most important book in my intellectual development. It forced me to recognize the importance of responsibility in pursuing cutting edge science (e.g. developing nuclear weapons), and also question our society’s capacity to morally utilize the knowledge produced by scientific research. Miller also introduced me to an interesting interpretation of religion that is much fuller than the straw men I’m used to dealing with (thanks to characters like Sam Harris). </p>
	  <p><em>Man’s Search For Meaning</em> by Victor Frankel was my first encounter with the cruel details of the Holocaust outside of an academic setting. It showed me that people can endure suffering much worse than they could ever imagine, but only if they have a deeply ingrained purpose. </p>
	  <p><em>Lifespan</em> by David Sinclair gave me hope that I was born in time to reach longevity escape velocity. Aging and disease suck; maybe we’re lucky enough to live in an era where scientific progress can completely mitigate them. I hope to be a part of this progress.</p>
	  <p>I know I’ve talked trash about self-help books, but <em>Can’t Hurt Me</em> by Navy SEAL David Goggins is the best self-help book in existence, written by someone who regularly accomplishes superhuman tasks. I have taken nearly all of Goggins' advice and it has completely reframed how I approach productivity and sharpening skill sets.</p>
	  <p>As someone living with autism, having an “algorithm” to interact with people is extremely helpful; <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> by Dale Carnegie provides the most effective algorithm I've found for this purpose. As Paul Graham recommends, you have to find an old copy, as the newer editions are watered down and less helpful. Retrieving extra information about how people are reacting to me in conversation is also helpful, and the book <em>What Every Body Is Saying</em> by Joe Navarro taught me how to interpret personal interaction beyond just what people express through language, which is great, since people don’t typically use speech literally.</p> 
	  <p>I haven’t read as much historical literature as I would like, but <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> taught me that people have held deep beliefs about the universe, heroes, and death since the beginning of civilization. For some reason, people today seem to think that earlier generations are essentially cavemen compared to them, but reading The Epic showed me that across millenia, very little about the human experience has changed. Plato’s <em>Apology</em> introduced me to the source of Socratic inquiry, and it is enlightening to read the genesis of Western philosophical and scientific thought. </p>
	  <p><em>The Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em> series is still funny to me–even as an adult–and I pick up the new copy every year. I must admit, there is probably some nostalgia factor at play here.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h2>Textbooks</h2>
	  <p>I recommend <em>Basic Mathematics</em> by Serge Lang for anyone who was unsatisfied with the rigor of their high school mathematics courses. This book helped me review precalculus before self-studying from MIT OCW and got me acquainted with proofs. If you want additional practice with proofs, check out <em>A Transition to Advanced Mathematics</em> by Chartrand. Doing hundreds of problems in this book helped me understand how to get deep in math, build a system of theorems from axioms and lemmas, and construct clear, concise, and complete proofs.</p>
	  <p><em>Calculus Vol 1</em> by Tom Apostol rigorously develops single variable calculus from the field and order axioms. This is the book that convinced me to major in math. Deeply understanding the concepts I found fascinating in introductory calculus and learning how those concepts rested on top of other theorems and axioms blew my mind.</p>
	  <p><em>Quantum Computation and Quantum Information</em> by Nielsen and Chuang introduced me to quantum computing and is excellent for learning about interesting theoretical concepts without having previously studied quantum mechanics. </p>
	  <br>
	  <h2>Articles</h2>
	  <p><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How to Become a Hacker</a> set me straight on the difference between hacking and cracking. It also helped guide the programming languages and software I learned at the beginning of my programming career.</p>
	  <p><a href="https://www.mccurley.org/advice/hamming_advice.html">The Hamming Advice</a> was pivotal in helping me figure out how to choose problems that are worth working on, and also that the ability to present my ideas well is important; I feel this last lesson rings especially true in our age of disinformation.</p>
	  <p>Learning to write good proofs and transitioning to advanced mathematics is tough; the inability to write a proof can be a serious blow to one's ego and self-confidence. <a href="http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/gowers/gowers_VIII_6.pdf">Advice to Young Mathematicians</a>, <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Poincare_Intuition/">Poincare on intuition in mathematics</a>, and Terrence Tao's <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/">There's more to math than rigour and proofs</a> were monumental in helping me understand the purpose of proof in mathematics. A proof isn't the end-all-be-all of math, just a tool of mathematical discovery. Intuition is still essential, and heuristic reasoning guides proof writing itself.</p> 
	  <p>Carl Sagan's <a href="https://highexistence.com/carl-sagans-profound-essay-on-why-cannabis-consciousness-is-desperately-needed-in-this-mad-and-dangerous-world/">Mr. X</a> essay investigates the scientist's relationship with weed. His reported experiences on the drug are very reflective of my own, except that he didn't experience anxiety or panic attacks.</p>
	  <p>I am a huge proponent of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> and spaced repetition learning. Nielsen's article <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> redefined how I write Anki cards and have imporved my efficiency and retention. You must atomize!</p>
	  <p>When I was getting my startup off the ground, a friend recommended that I read Paul Graham's essays. There are too many good ones to give you a comprehensive list, but some of my favorites are <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html">Relentlessly Resourceful</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">Why Nerds are Unpopular</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html">Cities and Ambition</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html">How to Make Wealth</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html">Undergraduation</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">What You'll Wish You'd Known</a>, and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html">Do Things that Don't Scale</a>.</p>
	  <p>Scott Aaronson's <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/">blog</a> never fails to be fascinating.</p>
  	  <br>
  	  <h2>Podcasts and Videos</h2>
	  <p>Lex Fridman has the best podcast on the web. Some of my favorite interviews are with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX5t8EivCaM">Scott Aaronson</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-2P3MSZrBM&t=1998s">Joscha Bach</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez773teNFYA">Stephen Wolfram</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t06rkOOUa7g&t=3002s">Manolis Kellis</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB8zcAttP1E&t=11700s">David Fravor</a>. Andrew Huberman also hosts an excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg">podcast</a> on neuroscience. I would be remiss not to mention Dan Carlin’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dancarlinpodcaster/videos">Hardcore History</a>, which is essential listening for those who love history. I also highly recommend <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a>, though sometimes I get annoyed with the implicit or explicit corporate, neoliberal narrative. I used to really like JRE and Making Sense with Sam Harris, but now Joe Rogan is just a conspiracy theorist, and Sam Harris is intellectually lazy, incapable of taking criticism, and platforms far too many right wingers to still consider himself a “liberal”.</p>
	  <p>When I was younger, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce">Vsauce</a> captivated my imagination by using science to explore deep questions that always lead to deeper truths. I attribute this channel to sparking my interest in science and encouraging me to pursue it as a career. I recommend you check out the old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbqGsjWTt40&list=PL2E357C14C00D6089">Mind Blows</a> from Vsuace2. It's interesting to see how many cool tech ideas never panned out, but also the few that did and have since been integrated into our lives. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium">Veratasium</a> produces similar content. Other science creators I like are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYNbYGl89UUowy8oXkipC-Q">Dr Becky</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnFmWQbVW_YbqPQZGNuq8sA">Andrew Dotson</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtAIs1VCQrymlAnw3mGonhw"</a>Flammable Maths</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzaYH6WeohiHKj3Ih_GdZdQ">Anastasia Marchenkova</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LookingGlassUniverse">Looking Glass Universe</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tibees">Tibees</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g">PBS Spacetime</a>.</p>
	  <p>I consume politics on YouTube, and the creators I like the most are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SecularTalk">Secular Talk</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SamSeder">The Majority Report</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtoaZpBnrd0lhycxYJ4MNOQ">Hasanabi</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MidweekPolitics">David Pakman</a>. Mainstream media is neoliberal garbage. I also regularly listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BenShapiro/videos">Ben Shaprio</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/StevenCrowder">Steven Crowder</a>, and conservative talk radio (burn in hell Rush!), which I think is a good idea for trying to understand the layers of misinformation on the right. I highly recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ContraPoints">Contrapoints</a> for deradicalization.</p>
	  <p>During my gap year, I got addicted to chess for a few months, and went from a rating of less than 100 to about 1100 (as of March 2021) in Bullet, Blitz, and Rapid. I watch a good number of chess content creators, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweCc7bSMX5J4jEH7HFImng">Hikaru Nakamura</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHP9CdeguNUI-_nBv_UXBhw">Daniel Naroditsky</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQHX6ViZmPsWiYSFAyS0a3Q">GothamChess</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AGADMATOR">agadmator</a>.</p>

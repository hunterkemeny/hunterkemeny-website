            <h2>About</h1>
            <p>
                Hi. I'm a Sophomore at Duke University studying Physics and Math. Well, actually, I'm at home on a gap year. Recently, I've been programming,
                taking courses on MIT OCW, trading stocks, and playing chess. I'm currently interested in human longevity, the intersection between theoretical 
                computer science and physics, and anything that'll help me understand existence. <a href="https://github.com/hunterkemeny/hunterkemeny-website">Source</a> for this website.
            </p>
    
            <br>
    
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <ul class="projects">
                <li>I recently finished the beta for my health app, called <a href="https://github.com/hunterkemeny/OneHealth">OneHealth</a>. The app suggests personalized daily workouts and meal plans to meet your
                    weight goal and provides the most up to date articles/podcasts/videos on nutrition science and longevity. It is currently under review by Apple to be posted on the App Store. <a href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
                </li>

                <li>I built a <a href ="">scalping algo-trader</a> for stocks that uses deep neural networks to predict next-minute price direction with ~65% accuracy. It's not quite profitable yet due to execution inefficiencies
                    and overtrading. However, I'm about to automate my profitable day trading routine so that I don't have to wake up at 6 am anymore.</li>

                <li>I founded a startup, <a href="https://github.com/hunterkemeny/KronaCash_Website">Krona</a>, with the intention of building an app to automate money saving. Users would theoretically 
                    save as much as physically possible just by owning the app. Unfortunately, we had to shut down because Coronavirus. You can find the app demo <a href="https://github.com/hunterkemeny/KronaCash">here</a>.</li>

                <li>I wrote a 700 page autobiography so that I can focus on the present.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <br>
    
            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                During the Fall of 2019, I had an experience that forced me to face the reality of my own mortality for the first time. I have 
                written a set of 13 essays on the philosophy inspired by my realization. After studying theoretical CS, I noticed that most of what 
                I wrote needs to be heavily revised to account for fundamental limitations on human knowledge. Email me if you want to read the original
                essays.
            </p>
    
            <br>
    
            <h2>Writing</h2>
               
            <p>
                I've been thinking a lot about learning, productivity, mindfulness, and scheduling. I might have some interesting things to say on these topics. I'm currently editing a few
                essays and will post them here when completed.

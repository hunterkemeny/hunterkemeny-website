        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm a Sophomore at Duke University studying Physics, Math, and
          Computer Science and am an incoming summer intern at the
          <a href="https://quantum.duke.edu/">Duke Quantum Center</a>. For the
          past two years, I've been on a gap year, and I've spent my time
          programming, taking courses on MIT OCW, trading stocks, and playing
          chess. I'm currently interested in human longevity, the intersection
          between theoretical computer science and physics, and anything that'll
          help me understand existence.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul class="projects">
          <li>
            I recently finished the beta for my health app, called
            <a href="https://github.com/hunterkemeny/OneHealth">OneHealth</a>.
            The app suggests personalized daily workouts and meal plans to meet
            your weight goal and provides the most up to date
            articles/podcasts/videos on nutrition science and longevity.
          </li>

          <li>
            I built a
            <a href="https://github.com/hunterkemeny/ScalpingAlgoTrader"
              >scalping algo-trader</a
            >
            for stocks that uses deep neural networks to predict next-minute
            price direction with ~65% accuracy. It's not quite profitable yet
            due to execution inefficiencies and overtrading. However, I'm about
            to automate my profitable day trading routine so that I don't have
            to wake up at 6 am anymore.
          </li>

          <li>
            I founded a startup,
            <a href="./kronacash-website/index.html">Krona</a>, with the
            intention of building an app to automate money saving. Users would
            theoretically save as much as physically possible just by owning the
            app. Unfortunately, we had to shut down because Coronavirus. You can
            find the app demo
            <a href="https://github.com/hunterkemeny/KronaCash">here</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
            I wrote a 700 page autobiography so that I can focus on the present.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br />

        <h2>Writing</h2>

        <p>
          Check out my essays on
          <a href="./blog/productivity.html">productivity</a>,
          <a href="./blog/software.html">software</a>, and
          <a href="./blog/recommendations.html">reading</a>. I might have some
          interesting things to say on these topics, and hopefully I can add
          more in the future. Email me at ahk22@duke.edu if you spot a problem
          in an essay, agree with me, disagree with me, or want to ask me a
          question!
